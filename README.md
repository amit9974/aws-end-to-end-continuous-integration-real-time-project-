🚀 Here's a step-by-step guide to create an end-to-end Continuous Integration (CI) pipeline on AWS using IAM, CodeBuild, CodePipeline, and Docker to build and push 
a Docker image to Docker Hub.

# Set Up AWS IAM Roles 🧑‍💼
Create IAM roles for your services, such as CodeBuildRole and CodePipelineRole, with appropriate permissions.
Attach policies for necessary AWS services like S3, ECR, and CodeBuild.

# Integrate with GitHub
Integrate your project with GitHub for Repository access.

# Push Code to GitHub 📦
Push your code to a source code repository like GitHub.

# Create an AWS CodeBuild Project 🏗️
Configure a CodeBuild project to build your application and create a Docker image.
Specify the Docker image name and tag.

# Set Up DockerHub Account 🐳
Create an account on Docker Hub (if you don't have one).
Create a repository to store your Docker image.
Configure SystemsManager Parameter for storing docker credentials.

# Create an AWS CodePipeline 🚀
Create a CodePipeline to automate the CI/CD process.
Connect your source repository and CodeBuild project.
Add a build stage to trigger CodeBuild.

# Configure AWS CodePipeline Stages ⚙️
Define stages in your pipeline:
Source: Connect to your code repository.
Build: Use CodeBuild to build the Docker image.
Deploy: Push the Docker image to Docker Hub.
Add Environment Variables 🤖

In CodeBuild, set environment variables for DockerHub credentials.
Ensure that these credentials are securely stored in AWS Secret Manager or SSM Parameter Store.

# Test and Validate Your Pipeline 🧪
Run a test build in CodePipeline to ensure everything works as expected.

# Start Build Project 🧪
Your docker image is start building & now it is sucessfully push on Docker Hub.
